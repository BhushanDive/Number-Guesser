## Guess the Number

Guess the Number is one of the many small Projects I created while learning Python in my freshman year of college.

I recently revisited my old projects and thought I could Modernize them in some way, to squeeze some more learning from these simple projects.

I wanted to give Native GUI development a try, so I chose Tkinter (Ttkbootstrap) since I got tired of web dev. I am not particularly sure about the way things have been handeled and the best practices that should have followed but I didnt want it to be too complex for just a simple game.

I wanted to implement a leader board system but it seemed like an overkill for a Number Guessing game.
